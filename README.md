Information Retrieval (aka web scraping) is the process of collecting information from a network resource. This document is a (WIP) introduction to differenct aspects and techniques involved in an information retrival system.

* acquiring or requesting a network resource
* parsing the payload
* transformation and storage

There is also a 4th step that's concerned with finding _what_ to reterieve, but we'll come to that later.
