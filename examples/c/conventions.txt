Code Conventions
================

Object Lifetime Isolation
    
    This is just fancy speak for saying that all objects created within a scope
    should be destroyed in that scope. The only exception to this rule are
    constructor functions. Use Container objects (dynamic arrays, hashtables)
    to pass information back to a caller.

    _cue jeena yaha marna yaha_

    This makes memory managment a little bit less painful, because you can look
    at a scope or block and be sure that any objects created within that block
    were freed.

Error Codes FTW

    As much as possible and where required, use error codes (preferbly ints) to
    convey success or any other messages. Using debug macros (check() in
    debug.h) makes error handling somewhat automated and fun.
